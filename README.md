# NDH Reference Implementation

## Notice of Deprecation

This repository represented [NDH STU1](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/ndh/STU1). The new repository for the STU2 server is located at https://github.com/HL7-FAST/ndh-server

## Summary

This is a FHIR server reference implementation of the [National Directory IG](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ndh/).  It is built on the [HAPI FHIR JPA Starter Project](https://github.com/hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter) project and more detailed configuration information can be found in that repository.

## Prerequisites
Building and running the server locally requires either Docker or
- Java 17+
- Maven

## Foundry
A live demo is hosted by [HL7 FHIR Foundry](https://foundry.hl7.org/products/130d22c8-8d06-4d38-98e7-90a7e68915b9), where you may also download curated configurations to run yourself.

## Building and Running the Server

There are multiple ways to build and run the server locally.  By default, the server's base FHIR endpoint will be available at http://localhost:8080/fhir

### Using Maven


```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```
or
```bash
mvn -Pjetty spring-boot:run
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Custom Operations

The reference implementation includes two custom operations to handle resource attestation and resource verification.  These operations are not defined in the NDH IG.

### `$attest` Operation

The `$attest` operation currently marks existing resource(s) as attested.  In this RI, resources are considered unattested if they include the following in their `meta.security` property:
```json
{
  "system": "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-Confidentiality",
  "code": "V"
}
```

The operation expects a FHIR `Parameters` body with the following structure that contains references to which resources should be marked as attested:
```
POST [fhir base]/$attest
```
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "resource",
      "valueReference": {
        "reference": "Practitioner/123"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The output of the operation is an `OperationOutcome`.


### `$verify` Operation

The `$verify` operation will mark a resource as verified by updating its [NDH Verification Status extension](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-us-ndh/StructureDefinition-base-ext-verification-status.html).

The operation expects a FHIR `Parameters` body with the following structure that contains references to which resources should be marked as verified and providing the "who" that is verifying the resource:
```
POST [fhir base]/$verify
```
```json
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "verification",
      "part": [
        {
          "name": "target",
          "valueReference": {
            "reference": "Practitioner/123"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "attestor",
          "valueReference": {
            "reference": "Organization/Hospital1"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


## Postman Collection

A basic Postman collection that demonstrates creating a new Practitioner, marking it as attested, and verifying it is available in the ndh.postman_collection.json file.
